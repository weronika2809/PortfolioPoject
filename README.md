## Covid Portfolio Project
This project provides basic data on COVID-19, focusing on cases and deaths in Europe. The project is based on data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths from the beginning of the pandemic up until December 20, 2022.


#### Project Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to present the total infection rate in individual European countries relative to their population, 
to present countries with the highest number of deaths per country, and to show the increase in total infection cases over time.

#### The tools I used:
  * Microsoft SQL Server management studio for exploring the data
  * Tableau Public for visualization
  * Microsoft Excel for data cleaning
